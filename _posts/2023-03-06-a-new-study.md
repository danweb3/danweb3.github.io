The Elegant Skeleton Research Institute has been hard at work since the success of our pilot study in October last year. We have been looking forward to bringing a brand new study to the general population so that we can learn more about humans. We are delighted to announce the details of our upcoming second research study.

The Game Expo has seen the extreme value that our research presents and is looking forward to amplifying the access of our study to the many attendees of the expo.
