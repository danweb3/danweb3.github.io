As we bring another Elegant Skeleton Research Institute research study to a close, we would like to express our gratitude to all participating research teams.

## Successful Study

Congratulations to all 20 teams who completed the entire Elegant Skeleton Public Aptitude Challenge for The Game Expo 2023. With 676 participating research teams, these 20 teams should be proud of accomplishing something 656 teams couldn't. A special congratulations to these top 10 teams and a special mention to team Redd for missing out on finishing by approximately 7 seconds.

Cosrep were defeated. Will Reverse Philosophy be defeated at our next study?

## Bonus

As part of each of our research studies we strive to include opportunities for participating humans to be challenged with bonuses. This study was no exception and the Elegant Skeleton Research Institute would like to express the strongest possible praise to those teams who were able to complete these bonuses before anyone else.

## Results

With so many teams taking part in this study it will take significant time for [our research team](/ourteam/) to navigate all the collected research data and draw conclusions. However, we are confident that we will be able to form significant conclusions based on the results of this study. We would like to thank The Game Expo for allowing us to make use of their attendees as test subjects for our second study investigating humans.
