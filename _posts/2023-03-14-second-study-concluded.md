As we bring another Elegant Skeleton Research Institute research study to a close, we would like to express our gratitude to all 676 participating research teams.

## Successful Study

Congratulations to all 20 teams who completed the entire Elegant Skeleton Public Aptitude Challenge for The Game Expo 2023. A special congratulations to these top 10 teams and a special mention to team Redd for missing out on finishing by approximately 7 seconds.

Cosrep were defeated. Will Reverse Philosophy be defeated at our next study?

## Results

With so many teams taking part in this study it will take significant time for our [research team](/ourteam/) to navigate all the collected research data and draw conclusions. However, we are confident that we will be able to form significant conclusions based on the results of this study and would like to thank The Game Expo for allowing us to make use of their attendees as test subjects for our second study investigating humans.
