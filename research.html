				<h2>Our <strong>Research</strong></h2>
				<p>Our goal at the Elegant Skeleton Research Institute is to investigate the aptitude of humans when they are presented with challenges. We are focussed on comparing the competency of humans while in teams with their competency operating alone.</p>
					
					<p>When humans take part in our research studies their every move is closely monitored by members of our team. Whether participating in a team or on their own, we are sure to collect as much data as possible about how the participants proceed through the challenges we present them with for our research. This includes <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/testimonials/">feedback</a> from our human test subjects.</p>
					
					<p>The Elegant Skeleton Research Institute has been operating since 2019. Due to the nature of our research we needed many years of preparations and planning before launching our first research study.</p>
					
					<p>This pilot research study began on the 7th of October 2022 and concluded on the 11th of October 2022. This pilot study was a great success for the Elegant Skeleton Research Institute. With 248 research teams or individuals taking part, we knew we would be able to grow into a powerful research team with future research studies.</p>
					
					<p>Our second research study began on the 11th of March 2023 and concluded on the 14th of March 2023. An incredible 676 research teams or individuals participated in this exciting new research study. It is clear that demand for our research is very high and we will strive to continue to allow all human members of the general public to participate in our future research.</p>
					
					<p>Future research studies may take place at any time. Current plans suggest we will have a new study ready to begin on October 6th 2023, however this date is subject to change.
